# Canadian Computing Competition (CCC) Solutions but in Python!

I started solving CCC problems late last year in December 2023 (Grade 12 ;-;) in preparation for CCC '24.

The repository contains my solutions to CCC problems from 2000 to 2023 that I have done.

The questions here were found and tested on https://dmoj.ca, while the test cases can be found at https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca.

My account on DMOJ is https://dmoj.ca/user/Achita.
